List of new Techniques Learnt

1. Subarray with given sum
	It can be broken into two prefixes,
	Left one with sum -> curr_sum-target
	Right one with sum -> curr_sum

2. Merging sorted array
	Bubble sort with Gaps (decreasing logarithmically)

3. Representing two numbers in one number
	Modulo and Division Trick
	Number a and b can be represented in x as
	a = x/large_number
	b = x%large_number

4. Longest Palindrome Substring
	Expand in both directions from the centre!
	For odd and even length separately

5. Use of Slow and Fast Pointer w/ Linked Lists
	Finding Middle Element
	Detecting Cycle
	Removing Cycle

6. List STL Data Structure
	Delete and insert at any position

7. Greatest Element in Subarray of length k in O(n) time using Queue
	Using Deque
	Don't need elements which have bigger element on right

8. Median of Stream using Heaps
	Two heaps, one for smaller than current median, one for greater

9. Binary Heap Data Structure (Check in DSA Folder)
	Build Heap
	Insert
	Extract top
	Delete
	Decrease/Increase


10. Strongly Connected Components in DIRECTED Graph using Kosaraju's Algorithm
	Find topological sort order
	Reverse graph
	Process Topsort order in reverse and DFS from the nodes from the last of the topsort order
	The nodes visited will give SCCs

11. Find Cycle of Given Length K
	Find a path of length K-1 and then see if the last node leads back to the start Node

	It is kind of backtracking so Mark nodes visited then recurse on children and after that mark the nodes unvisited

12. Counting Problems DP/MEMO
	Usually Base cases have value 1
	Most of the times built in a Forward movement i,j increases, depends on previous
